The love story with Emacs
How and why
- Introspectability
- Giant security hole, secured by strong culture for FLOSS
- Unmatched malleability from Lisp!
  - Integration with Nix!
    - Honorable mention to yakspkgs
- Mature and adult treatment of users
- Documentation!
- All the tooling for Elisp available at fingertips
- ChatGPT :p
- Sprawling configuration over years, supported by modern practices:
  - doom
  - straight.el
  - use-package
  - dash.el
- Packages (small intro, should ideally be their separate posts, preferrably in same series)
  - org-mode
    - org-roam
    - age.el
    - org-babel
    - ox-hugo
  - magit
  - mu4e
