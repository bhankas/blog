* What is this?

So, after nearly a year, and a LOT of $LIFE stuff, here's my next best attempt at blogging.

I have no idea what I intend to write here as of now, but I'll just go with the flow.

* Why is this?

Because I can.

* Who am I?

I'll try to add some info on homepage sometime soonâ„¢.

* What technology stack is being used?
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] : To write stuff down
- [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode for Emacs]] : As markup of choice
- [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] : To convert =.org= files into =.md= compatible with Hugo. Hugo comes with orgmode support built-in, so that's one less thing to worry about :)
- [[https://pages.github.com/][Github pages]] : To actually get this on the internet. Because I still haven't setup Cloudflare tunnel on my Pi (Big surprise there, not)
